# Machine Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey learning machine learning—from fundamentals to a wide range of algorithms. The goal is to learn by building, experimenting, and writing down what I understood (and what I didn’t) as I go.

## Goals
- Learn machine learning concepts step-by-step
- Implement and experiment with different algorithms
- Practice good ML habits: data splits, evaluation, and reproducibility
- Keep short notes on what I learned from each project

## Current Progress ✅
### 1) k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) — Classification
**Dataset:** Iris Flower Dataset (from `sklearn`)  
**What I practiced:**
- Loading a dataset using scikit-learn
- Splitting into train/test sets
- Training a kNN classifier
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Evaluating accuracy (and comparing different `k` values)
